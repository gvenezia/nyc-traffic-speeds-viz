# NYC Traffic Speeds Data Visualization
The visualization displays traffic speeds along key corridors It uses data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/DOT-Traffic-Speeds-NBE/i4gi-tjb9) and displays that information with D3 and the Google Maps API. 

### Tech Used
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)  
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) (Note: register with Google Cloud Platform to get rid of the "For development purposes only" text and color overlay. Small-scale uses shouldn't incur any charges. I've only used <0.0001% of my free allowance)  
- Excel for data reformatting
- CSS
- HTML
- SODA API for NYC Open Data (I highly recommend using the API to filter the data requests since the full datasets can be very large for a personal computer [ex. 22.3 million rows in this case])
